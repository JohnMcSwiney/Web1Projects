    <h2 style="text-align:center">First paragraph!</h2>
    <p class="center">Far far away, behind the word mountains, 
        far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, 
        the, re live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove 
        right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. 
        A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies 
        it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, 
        in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>

    <br>
    <h3 style="text-align:center">Second paragraph!</h3>
    <p class="center">Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind 
        texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small 
        line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for 
        the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, 
        because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks 
        and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen. 
        She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made 
        herself on the way.</p>

    <br>
    <h4 style="text-align:center">Third paragraph!</h4>
    <p class="center">When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, 
        she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, 
        the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, 
        the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, 
        then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy. 
        The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from 
        it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that 
        was left from its origin would be the word "and" 
        and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, 
        safe country.</p>
